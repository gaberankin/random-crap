<h2>Much Stupid. Wow</h2>
<div class="cf btn" id="doge1">
	<img src="images/doge.png" title="Such Uselessness" class="icon">
	<h3>Click here for doge</h3>
</div>

<p>So, one day I found something called <a href="http://zurb.com/playground/jquery-raptorize" target="_blank">raptorize</a>.</p>

<p><em>Hey</em>,  I thought, <em>That's funny in a kind of non-funny way!</em></p>

<p>Then I realized that it would be way sillier if it was the doge.  I like the doge.  He's got this look on his face that makes you feel both uncomfortable and paranoid.</p>

<p>Or maybe that's just me.</p>

<p>Probably just me.</p>

<hr />

<p>It's a fairly simple jquery plugin, not much to it aside from 3 files (2 images and the jquery.doge.js javascript file), not including the jquery requirement:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/doge/jquery.doge.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The code for the above demo is thus:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
  $('#doge1').doge({
    imagePath: 'javascripts/doge',
    begin: function(){
      $('#doge1 h3').data('original-text', $('#doge1 h3').text()).text('much comedy');
    },
    complete: function(){
      $('#doge1 h3').text($('#doge1 h3').data('original-text'));
    }
  });
});</code></pre>

<p>The main thing to be concerned with is to make sure that the plugin can find the doge images, which is what the <code>imagePath</code> option is for.  This path should be relative to the page that is calling the plugin.<p>

<p>The <code>begin</code> and <code>complete</code> options are callbacks that occur at the start and end of the doge animations.  What I'm doing here is changing the text of the button while the event occurs, and reverting it after it's complete.</p>

<p>There are two more options that I'm not using here in the demo: <code>enterOn</code> (either 'click' or 'timer'.  'click' is the default) and <code>delayTime</code> (represented in milliseconds, is the length of time that the timer should run before the doge animation begins after the plugin code is run).  These two options can be used for surprises.</p>
